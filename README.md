## The Caps App


#### This is built with VS Code and the [BrightScript Language][1] extension
[1]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RokuCommunity.brightscript/ "BrightScript Extension"

### What it is:

- This is a side project that I used to get more comfortable with Brightscript.  It was requested by my wife to help her learn the names of the Washington Capitals' roster.

### What it is not:

- This is not something to be monetized.
